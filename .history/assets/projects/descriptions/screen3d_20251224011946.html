            Take a screenshot of the application running in "Transparent Mode" over your actual desktop wallpaper.
            Place a 3D object (like the Dragon or Room) so it looks like it's floating in your screen.
            This sells the "Hologram" effect immediately.

                <h2>~ Overview ~</h2>
                <p>
                    This project turns a standard 2D monitor into a <strong>holographic window</strong>. 
                    By tracking the user's head position in real-time using stereo computer vision, the application 
                    dynamically distorts the 3D projection matrix. This creates an <em>Off-Axis Projection</em>, 
                    giving the illusion that the screen is a transparent pane of glass looking into a virtual world. 
                    Additionally, it can create holograms that appear to emerge from the screen when viewed with one eye closed or through a camera.
                </p>

                <h2>~ Features ~</h2>
                <p>
                    The system features a custom <strong>Stereo Head Tracker</strong> using MediaPipe and OpenCV, 
                    a <strong>Calibration Suite</strong> for precise camera extrinsics, and a <strong>Transparent Overlay</strong> 
                    mode that integrates 3D objects seamlessly into the Windows desktop environment.

                    The camera should be fixed (recording the screen), showing how the perspective of the 3D room changes 
                    based on your head movement. This "Parallax" effect is the key feature.
